Task 3:
The training of the tree is too slow because of the number of test features
 to go over to find the best split
The predictive segmentation mask using the learned tree parameters is decent,
 with the key classes being classified almost correctly with some noise
The algorithm fails sto provide excellent segmentation masks for the following reasons:
- We take only the ground truth label of the center pixel of the patch, ignoring the neighborhood training_patches_labels
- We do not assume any prior over the labels.
  Some kind of smoothness prior can help to reduce salt-and-pepper like noise
- The performance of the algorithm can be improved by taking more diverse features than just RGB color patches
    - Gradient information can help introduce invariance to illumination changes
    - An ensemble of patch sizes can help provide some sort of scale invariance as well
